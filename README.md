# eco
Eye contact online

A tiny utility enabling easier eye contact with people in an online video call (like a Teams meeting). Often your video meeting software shows the images of the fellow organisms you're communicating with in a far corner of your screen (especially when someone is sharing their screen), while your camera is at the top. Instead of begging and pleading with your video conferencing provider, eco allows you to show a live copy of your call partners in a small window at the top of the screen.

Below a screenshot showing eco in action:

Currently, there is no easy way to install eco, but I'm open to ideas on how we can improve this.

Besides being an abbreviation of eye contact online, the name eco also was inspired by the [definition of ecology on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology), since we are all interacting organisms in a challenging environment:
> "Ecology is a branch of biology concerning interactions among organisms and their biophysical environment [...]"
